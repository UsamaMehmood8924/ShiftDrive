Due to advancement in technology getting a car is cheap, but maintaining it is very expensive. It is also difficult to get a good mechanic. The proposed automated system for dealing with this problem can classify the damaged vehicle and then predict the estimated cost for the damage repair. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) can be used for the understanding, detecting and analyzing various classes of the damage in the minor and major parts of the car. The damages can be of any type like bumper dent, door dent, glass shatter, head lamp broken, scratch and smash. Moreover, this system also allows customization of car by enabling the user to put stickers on their car and have a new look of their car before physical customization. Along with all these features, users can interact with each other via provided built-in social network.
